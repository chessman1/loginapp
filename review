This is an application with registering users. I use MongoDB. A registered user can change his/her profile picture. 
There is an option to log in with Facebook profile. The user has options to change his/her password. There are 
simple instructions how to change password. There are confirmation emails and other easy steps. There is chat. Two registered users
can chat each other. The chat is made with socket.io. The app is responsive.
I have tested the app in website which tests responsive design. Also I have idea to develop other features. 

I use Express.js framework and similar technologies. The FE part is made with HTML, CSS. I have an idea to develop FE part with
Vue.js framework. Bootstrap 4 is used for responsive design. BE part is made with Node.js. I wanted to be the same language
on both FE and BE. The feature which is valuable is that the user can log in with FB. It can be with other social websites. The
method is the same. There is special website for developers for the current social website. For example FB has website for 
developers and there are keys which are copied in the source code. There is good documentation about it. The thing I like is 
to learn good practices. For example when user add picture, there is a folder upload which saves pictures. The path to picture
is saved on MongoDB. I use handlebars for template engine. I have main layout which applies to the app. There are some simple 
features which can be made with similar technologies.
